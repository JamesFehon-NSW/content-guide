The terms 'First Australians' and 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' include distinct and diverse cultural groups. They do not represent a homogenous group.

### Find out the user's preference

The following terms are general guides.

The words that First Australians use to refer to themselves may be different depending on where they are from. They can also change over time.

Wherever possible you should find out the user's preferred words.

#### Use the correct language group name if possible

The [Australian Indigenous Languages Database](http://austlang.aiatsis.gov.au/main.php){:rel="external"} from AIATSIS may help you identify the appropriate local language.

Use 'First Australians' or 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' (note the plural) if you are not sure of the local language group or are talking about multiple groups.

First Australian is not generally used in reference to an individual.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "preferred terms for referring to First Australians"

- We want to find out how to better meet the needs of First Australians.
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have distinct identities, histories and cultural traditions.

If appropriate you can use the terms 'Aboriginal peoples' and 'Torres Strait Islander peoples' on their own.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "using Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples"
  content= "
- The Aboriginal flag was created as a symbol of unity and national identity for Aboriginal peoples during the land rights movement of the early 1970s.
- Aboriginal Elder.
- The Torres Strait Islander flag was created as a symbol of unity and identity for Torres Strait Islander peoples.

"

Don't use:

- Aboriginals, Aborigine — these words are associated with colonisation and assimilation and are distressing to many people
- ATSI — never use the acronym ATSI as this is considered disrespectful
- Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Australians.

### Be careful using the word 'Indigenous'

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many First Australians.

Indigenous is the common term when referring to a business entity or business function.

Indigenous should always be capitalised.

- Indigenous Specialist Officer
- Indigenous Services Branch
