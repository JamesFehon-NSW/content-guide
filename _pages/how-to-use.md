We know [Australians prefer to use digital government services](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/how-do-australians-really-feel-about-digital-government-services/){:rel="external"}. We need to make it easy for all users to access the services they need.

The Content Guide helps teams design content that is accessible to all users regardless of their ability and environment.

The GOV.AU Content Guide and the [DTA Design Guide](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide) are part of a suite of guidance products designed to help teams build services that meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/){:rel="external"}.

## Start here

If you're new to content design we suggest you read this first:

- [content structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-structure/)
- [plain English and writing style]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing-style/)
- [making accessible and inclusive content]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility-inclusivity/)

If you're an experienced content creator, check guidance on:

- [spelling government terms and phrases]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms-phrases)
- [how we punctuate]({{ site.baseurl }}/punctuation-grammar)
- [writing numbers and measurements]({{ site.baseurl }}/numbers-measurements)

We're working on [guidance on content types]({{ site.baseurl }}/types-of-content), including documents, forms and surveys.

You'll find guidance on how we use the UI-Kit CSS framework to build common design patterns in the [DTA Design Guide](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/).

## How we write this guide

The Content Guide is a living product built by the Digital Transformation Agency with the support and guidance of the wider government content community.

It  will continue to grow based on feedback, research and work on other DTA products.

The [original sources for the Content Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/sources/) included the GOV.UK style guide, 18F Content Guide, The Guardian and Observer style guide and Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers.

## Use the guide in your organisation

We encourage Australian government teams to use the Content Guide to replace or complement their own style guides.

If you're not part of an Australian Government team we'd still encourage you to make use of this guidance.
