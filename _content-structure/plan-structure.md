You need to understand the user's needs before you write anything.

Structure the content around meeting the user's needs first, then meeting requirements around mandated information.

Design content to:
- give the user only the information they need to complete the service
- lead the user to the information they need.

## Design for mobile devices first

People are using phones and tablet devices more often to access government services. But users still need use these services on desktop and laptop devices.

Use [responsive design methods](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/){:rel="external"} to make sure people can use your content on all their devices.

Mobile devices are less accessible than a desktop or laptop computer.

So start by making the content work for your users on phones and tablets. Then make sure the content works on devices with larger screens.

### Communicate with text first

Don't rely on video and images to convey important information.

Plain text can reflow and resize to fit all size screens.

Images and video are much less accessible across mobile devices.

Users may not be able to watch a long video in the context where they are using a mobile device, for example on a bus.

### Get to the point

It's harder for users with mobile devices to consume long content.

Work out the user needs and plan to meet them first.

### Make forms work on mobiles

Plan forms that are easy to use on small touch screens.

There's guidance on [making accessible forms](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/components/forms-buttons/) in the DTA Design Guide.

### Use clear typography

Use typography and colours that make text readable and usable on all user devices.

There's [guidance on typography and colours](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/foundations/) in the DTA Design Guide.

### Avoid PDFs or other documents

Don't bury information in PDFs or Word documents. These formats are not accessible on mobile devices.
