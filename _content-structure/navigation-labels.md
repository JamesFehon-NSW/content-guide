Write the navigation label to meet the user's need.

The label should tell all users what they will find at the destination. Often it will be the same as the page title.

Keyword analysis tools can help.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "navigation labels"
  content= "
Navigation label: News

Page title: Latest news and media releases
"
%}

Use sentence case (an initial capital then lower case) for navigation labels, except when using proper nouns.
