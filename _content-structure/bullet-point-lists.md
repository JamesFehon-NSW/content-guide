Break up long sentences with lists to make it easier for the user to scan.

### Consistent list items

Write lead-in content that introduces the list and ends with a colon (:).

Use a parallel structure for items so they all start in the same way. For example, start each item with a noun or a verb that is a familiar keyword for the user.

Aim to make each list item a similar size. This makes lists easier to scan.

Don't add a [semicolon](/punctuation-grammar/#semicolons) to the end of list items.

### Sentence fragment bullet point list

For lists of fragments use minimal punctuation.

Don't add a full stop after the final point.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "sentence fragment bullet point list"
  content= "
The environmental protection plan includes:

- site inspection
- sustainability report
- ongoing benchmarks
"
%}

### Full sentence bullet point list

For a list of full sentences, use a capital letter at the start of each point and end each item with a full stop.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "bullet point list for full sentences"
  content= "
Awareness week agenda:

- Community morning tea hosted by the Director.
- Launch of awareness week book.
"
%}

### Numbered (ordered) lists

Only use a numbered list for ordered steps or to show priority.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "numbered list"
  content= "
Sentence fragment numbered list:

>On Wednesday we run agile ceremonies in this order:
>
> 1. daily standup
> 2. retrospective
> 3. planning
> 4. showcase

Full sentence numbered list:

> How to register for conference:
>
> 1. Choose the number of days you will attend.
> 2. Pick the workshops you will join.
> 3. Enter your discount code (if you have one).
"
%}

### Avoid second and third level lists

Rewrite content to avoid multi-level lists.

It makes it harder for the user to understand a list if it has more than 1 level.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "rewriting to reduce levels of lists"
  content= "
Like this:
> To register you need to show your referral document to the registrar.
>
> You also need to show 2 forms of identification:
> - proof of your name
> - proof of your address
>
> You can't use the same form of identification for name and address.
>
> Proof of name:
> - driver’s license
> - marriage certificate
>
> Proof of address:
> - driver’s license
> - bank statement
> - bill

Not this:
> To register you need to show to the registrar:
> - your referral document
> - 2 forms of identification to prove who you are and where you live (you can’t use the same form for both name and address):
>   - proof of name:
>     - driver’s license
>     - marriage certificate
>   - proof of address:
>     - driver’s license
>     - bank statement
>     - bill
