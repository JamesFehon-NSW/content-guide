People use a variety of devices to access government information and services. These include mobile phones, tablet devices (for example, iPads), desktop computers and laptops.

Use [responsive design methods](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/){:rel="external"} to make sure users can read your content on **all** their devices.

It can be much harder for some people with disability to use a mobile device than a desktop or laptop computer.

Think about how the content will work on a mobile device first. Then think about how it will translate to a larger screen.

### Communicate with text first

Don't rely on video and images to convey important information.

Plain text can reflow and resize to fit all size screens.

It's harder to make images and video accessible across different mobile devices.

Users may not be able to watch a long video in the context where they are using a mobile device (for example, on a bus).

### Get to the point

Find out the user needs and plan to meet them first.

It's harder for users with mobile devices to consume long content.

### Make forms work on mobiles

Plan forms that are easy to use on small touch screens.

There's guidance on [making accessible forms](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/components/forms-buttons/) in the DTA Design Guide.

### Use clear typography

Use typography and accessible contrasts that make text readable on all devices.

There's [guidance on typography and colours](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/foundations/) in the DTA Design Guide.

### Avoid PDFs and other documents

Don't bury information in PDFs or other documents.

PDFs and Word documents are not accessible on mobile devices.
