Use active voice (subject-verb-object).

Use first and second person (we, us) instead of third person (he, she, it and they).

Active voice gets straight to the point.

Avoid passive voice (object-verb-subject).

Passive voice usually makes it difficult to know who did what to whom and sends the reader backwards.

Like this:

> - The committee (subject) campaigned (verb) to lower diabetes (object).
> - We (subject) did not accept (verb) your application (object).

Not this:

> - The lowering of diabetes was campaigned for by the committee.
> - It was deemed your application was unsuccessful.

You can use passive voice if you can't specify the do-er of the action.
