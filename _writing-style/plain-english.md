Government content needs to communicate in a way that most people understand.

The best way to do this is by using common words, or plain English.

Writing in plain English means using simpler and more direct language.

It does not mean ‘dumbing down’ information.

### How to write in plain English

- Write less and [structure content](/content-structure/) around the needs of the user.
- Use [active voice](#voice) --- not passive.
- Choose the shorter [plain English word, term, sentence](/terms-phrases/#plain-english-terms) and paragraph over the longer.
- Avoid jargon so the user can understand the first time they read the content.
- Minimise punctuation. Use several short sentences instead of a long sentence broken up with punctuation.

### Make sure all of the users can understand

If you’re writing for a specialist audience, you still need to make sure everyone can understand what the content is about.

Write in plain English so everyone can understand, regardless of their ability.

Think about the [needs of users who speak a language other than English](/accessibility-inclusivity/#languages-other-than-english).
