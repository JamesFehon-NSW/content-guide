Readability is about how easy or hard it is for a user to understand text.

Content with a good readability level helps users know what to do. This includes users with lower comprehension skills.

### Use readability tools carefully

The 'Flesch reading ease' index is a common measure for content. It is built into many readability tools.

Writing with a high Flesch reading ease score (about 100) is easy to read.

Readability tools can show where content can be improved. They can also give you useful metrics to use to suggest changes to stakeholders.

Some tools give suggestions to make text more readable. Be careful using automatic recommendations. Sometimes the user will be more familiar with a longer keyword.

### Don't just test the reading level

In addition to testing content for readability, you need to test:

- findability --- can users easily find it?
- comprehension --- can users understand it?
- engagement --- do users read enough of it to understand or skim over it?
- effectiveness --- does it provide the right information/answers and cover what the user needs to know?

### Write for Year 5 reading level

When most people reach Year 5 reading level (around age 9) the way they read content has changed.

By 9 years old most children stop reading whole words and start reading by recognising shapes. This allows people to read much faster.

Most readers donâ€™t read one word at a time. They bounce around, especially online. They expect words and fill them in. An adult brain can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand the content.

A person's vocabulary will grow as they age but the shape-recognition reading skill stays with them.

Writing for the Year 5 reading level, [structuring your writing](/content-structure/) and [writing in plain English](#plain-english) will make it easier for the user to understand your content.
