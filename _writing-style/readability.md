Readability is about how easy or hard it is for a user to understand text.

Content with a good readability level helps users know what to do. This includes users with lower comprehension skills.

### Use readability tools carefully

The Flesch reading ease index is a common measure for content. It is built into many readability tools.

Text with a very high 'Flesch reading ease' score (about 100) are very easy to read.

Readability tools are useful to help show where content can be improved. They can also give you helpful metrics to use to suggest changes to stakeholders.

Some tools give suggestions to make text more readable. Be careful just using the shortest word. Sometimes the user will be more familiar with a longer keyword.

### Don't just test the reading level

In addition to testing content for readability, you need to test:

- findability --- can users easily find it?
- comprehension --- can users understand it?
- engagement --- do users read enough of it to understand or skim over it?
- effectiveness --- does it provide the right information/answers and cover what the user needs to know?

### Understand how users read

You should write for Year 5 (9 year old) reading age.

At around age 9 most people start reading by recognising shapes. Up until then they consciously read each word, which is much slower.

Adult brains can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand the content.

Although vocabulary grows as people get older, they continue to read by skimming text, looking for shapes.

They bounce around a page, especially online. They anticipate words and fill them in.
