Avoid using FAQs (frequently asked questions).

FAQs date easily and suggest that web content is out of touch with the user's needs.

Instead of writing FAQs, write answers to important questions in the places where the user will expect to find them.

If FAQs are essential make sure they are useful, well-edited and link directly to the places the user needs to go next.

Group FAQs under topics for quick reference and regularly update them using feedback loops.
