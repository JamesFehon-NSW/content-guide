Make surveys accessible. Keep them short and relevant. Say how long the survey will take to complete.

Follow the [DTA Content Guide on making forms](#forms).

### Make the title of the survey clear

Use the title to remind the user what they are being asked about.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "referencing a PDF"
  content= "
Title: School canteen survey

Brief description: Have your say about our proposed new canteen menu.

### Write clear survey questions

Avoid ambiguity in questions.

Provide a short explanation of why you are asking each question.

If you use an open-ended question think how you will report on that data.

### Test your survey before you send it

Surveys are quick and convenient. But it’s easy to accidentally collect misleading data.

Before you send a survey:
1. Find 3 people who match the target audience of your survey.
2. Ask them to complete the survey. Don’t just email it. Watch them while they do it. Ask questions to see if they understand what’s been asked of them.
3. Go back and adjust your questions and survey design based on what you’ve observed.
