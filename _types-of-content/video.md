Videos can be a useful way to deliver short snippets of information --- if there is a user need. For example, videos can make complex written information easier to understand.

Video should be a complementary channel. It should enhance written information.

### Make the video accessible

Read
[guidance on transcripts, closed captions and audio description]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility-inclusivity/#video-accessibility).

### Write a focused script

Think about what the user needs to know and make this your main focus.

Get to the point early on.

Check the [voice and tone]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing-style/). Use humour sensitively.

### Think visually

Show, donâ€™t tell. Use imagery that describes what you're trying to say instead of adding a lengthy narrative.

### Make videos short

People prefer informational videos to be less than 2 minutes long.

The longer a video gets the more likely the user will stop watching.
