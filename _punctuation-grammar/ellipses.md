---

Use ellipses after text when deliberately leaving something out --- for example in the middle of a long quote.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "referencing a PDF"
  content= "
Full quotation: 'Today, after user research, we analysed the results.'

With ellipsis: 'Today ... we analysed the results.'
"
%}

Use a space on either side of the ellipsis except when it's followed by a question mark.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "referencing a PDF"
  content= "
'Today we will analyse ...?'
"
%}
