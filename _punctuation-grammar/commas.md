Use commas minimally.

Commas increase clarity because they bring in a natural pause. But too many commas are a sign a sentence should be shorter, or needs to be changed into a [bullet point list](/content-structure/#bullet-point-lists).

Like this:

> Cabinet discussed the proposal, then we issued a media release.

Not this:

> The proposal, which was discussed in Cabinet, prompted a media release by us.

### Avoid Oxford commas

Restructure content to avoid sentences that need Oxford commas (a comma before the final ‘and’ or ‘or’ in a sentence).
