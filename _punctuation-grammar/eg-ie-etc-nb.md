Avoid the Latin abbreviations eg, ie, etc (et cetera) and nb.

[Don't use italics for Latin]({{ site.baseurl }}/formatting/#italics).

### eg

Use ‘for example’ instead of ‘eg’.

If space is limited you can use &#8217;eg&#8217; (for example, in a table). Only do this if your users can understand it. Sometimes screen readers won’t read 'eg' correctly.

### ie

Avoid using ‘that is’ or ‘meaning’ as an alternative to ‘ie’. Rewrite and restructure your content instead.

### etc

Try to rewrite the sentence so the user does not need to guess what the 'etc' refers to.

### nb

Do not use 'nb' (nota bene or ‘note well’).
