Avoid the Latin abbreviations eg, ie, etc and nb.

[Don't use italics for Latin](/formatting/#italics).

Use 'for example' instead of &#8217;eg&#8217;.

If space is limited, for example in a table, you can use &#8217;eg&#8217;.

Only do this if your users can understand it (sometimes screen readers won't read it correctly).

Avoid using 'that is' or 'meaning' as an alternative to &#8217;ie&#8217;. Rewrite and restructure your content instead.
