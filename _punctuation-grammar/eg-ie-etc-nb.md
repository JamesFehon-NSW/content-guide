Avoid the Latin abbreviations eg, ie, etc and nb.

[Don't use italics for Latin](/formatting/#italics).

Use 'for example' instead of eg.

If space is limited, for example in a table, you can use eg.

Only do this if your users can understand it (sometimes screen readers won't read it correctly).

Avoid using 'that is' or 'meaning' as an alternative to ie. Rewrite and restructure your content instead.
