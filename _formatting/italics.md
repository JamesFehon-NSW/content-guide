Avoid using *italics*.

Screen readers interpret italics in different ways.

Users with dyslexia can find italics very difficult to read.

Don't use italics in headlines.

Use [capitals instead of italics for acts and other publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/punctuation-grammar/#capitalisation). Link to the source where possible.

### Avoid Latin words

Instead of Latin words, use plain English where possible.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "avoiding Latin words"
  content= "
a long time --- not _ad infinitum_
"
%}

See guidance on [eg, ie, etc and nb]({{ site.baseurl }}/punctuation-grammar/#eg-ie-etc-and-nb).

An exception would be for scientific names.

Declare the language as Latin in the HTML so the screen reader will pronounce it correctly.
