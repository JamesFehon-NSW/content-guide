The Content Guide is part of a suite of guide products for Australian Government teams, including the [DTA Design Guide](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/).

The guides help teams build services that are simple, clear and fast, and meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/){:rel="external"}.

If you're not part of an Australian Government team we'd still encourage you to make use of this guidance.

All of the guidance is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://github.com/govau/content-guide/blob/master/LICENSE.md){:rel="external"}.

Be great. Be consistent. Love the Guides.

## Start here

If you're new to content design we suggest you read about [structuring content](/content-structure/), [plain English and writing style](/writing-style/) and making sure your [writing is inclusive and accessible](/accessibility-inclusivity/).

If you're an experienced content creator, check quick reference guides on how to spell [government terms and phrases](/terms-phrases), [how we punctuate](/punctuation-grammar) and [write numbers for screens](/numbers-measurements).

We are also working on [guidance on content types](/types-of-content), including documents, forms and survey.

You'll find guidance on how we use the UI-Kit CSS framework to build content types in the [DTA Design Guide](http://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/).
