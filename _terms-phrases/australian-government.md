Use 'Australian Government' when talking about the national government of Australia. Don't use 'Government', 'Commonwealth Government' or 'federal government'.

Only use the ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ when talking about the legal entity established by the Constitution.

Only capitalise 'government', 'group', 'parliament', 'state' and 'territory' in a formal title.

Also see guidance on [capitalising legislation and government publications](/punctuation-grammar/#capitalisation).
