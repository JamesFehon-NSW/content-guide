# Privacy policy --- Guides team (Digital Transformation Agency)

## Scope

The [Australian Privacy Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/privacy-fact-sheets/general/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles) (APPs) set out in the [Privacy ACT 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712) require the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) to have a privacy policy.  This privacy policy sets out the practices of the Guides team in the DTA in relation to handling personal information.

The [Digital Transformation Agency has its own Privacy Policy](https://www.dta.gov.au/privacy-statement/) that also applies.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to:
  - clearly communicate the DTA’s practices for handling personal information
  - enhance the transparency of the DTA’s operations
  - give you a better and more complete understanding of the sort of personal information that the DTA holds, and the way we handle that information.

The DTA takes its privacy obligations very seriously. We are committed to meeting the highest standards when we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information.

The specific legal obligations of the DTA when collecting and handling your personal information are set out in the Privacy Act 1988 and the APPs. The APPs:
  - set out legally binding standards for handling personal information
  - regulate how we collect, store, use and disclose personal information
  - allow people to access the information that we keep about them
  - allow people to correct or update their information.

The website of the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner contains further information about privacy](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy), including the APPs, legislation and policies.

We may review and update this policy from time to time, to take account of new laws or technology, or changes to the DTA’s priorities, functions, operations or practices. If we do, we will publish any updates on our website.

## Collecting your personal information

The DTA collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information to achieve our priorities and carry out our functions and activities.

The DTA works with government agencies to make services simpler, clearer and faster for everyone.

The Guides team in the DTA works with government agencies to provide guidance and tools to build simple, clear and fast services.

These functions and activities of the Guides team include:
  - sharing code ([the UI-Kit product](https://github.com/govau/uikit)) to build digital services
  - providing guidance on building digital services ([DTA Design Guide](https://github.com/AusDTO/dto-design-guide) and [GOV.AU Content Guide products](https://github.com/govau/content-guide))
  - researching with users to improve our products
  - providing training and presentations on our product.

The DTA currently collects and holds the types of personal information that are described in [Schedule 1](#schedule-1) of this policy. For each type of personal information listed in Schedule 1, we have also described:
  - the purpose for which we collect, hold, use and disclose the information
  - the content of the information, including any sensitive content
  - who the information is about
  - whether the information is usually accessed by or disclosed to third parties.

We only collect personal information by lawful and fair means. We usually collect it directly from you. For example, we might collect personal information:
  - when you submit email addresses and other personal information through one of the websites we manage
  - from you writing to us or contacting us.

We will comply with the requirements in [APP 5](https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/privacy-fact-sheets/general/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles#australian-privacy-principle-5-notification-of-the-collection-of-personal-information) to notify you of a number of things before we collect information.

Those things include the purpose for which we are collecting your personal information, and whether the DTA usually discloses that personal information to any other organisation or government agency.

We try to only collect the personal information we need for the particular function or activity we are carrying out. If we do not collect your personal information, we will generally not be in a position to undertake the relevant function or activity.

We are sometimes given personal information that we have not asked for, including information sent to us via guides@digital.gov.au or content@digital.gov.au. This is called 'unsolicited personal information'.

When we receive unsolicited personal information, we will comply with the requirements regarding dealing with that kind of personal information set out in [APP 4](https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/privacy-fact-sheets/general/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles#australian-privacy-principle-4-dealing-with-unsolicited-personal-information).

Certain information we collect is called ‘sensitive information’ in the Privacy Act. This includes, for example, details of disability in user research records. The DTA generally only collects and holds sensitive information with the consent of the relevant individual.

Where possible, we will allow you to interact with us anonymously or using a pseudonym. For example, if you contact us with a general question we will not ask for your name unless we need it to properly handle your question. However, for most of our functions and activities we usually need your name and contact details.

The Guides team in the DTA has several public websites hosted at: http://guides.service.gov.au/

Each of these websites has their own privacy statements. These privacy statements notify users of information relevant to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected through those particular websites.

The code for these websites are hosted in public repositories in GitHub.

Users can comment on, submit issues and pull requests to these repositories. When these are submitted to GitHub they become part of the code of these websites.

[GitHub has its own privacy statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

We use a range of tools provided by third parties, such as Google Analytics, to collect or view website traffic information. These sites have their own privacy policies, for example, the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

We also use cookies and session tools to improve your experience when accessing our website and the websites we manage.

The information collected by these tools may include:
  - the IP address of the device you are using and information about sites that IP address has come from
  - the pages accessed on our site
  - the next site visited.

We use this information to maintain, secure and improve our websites and to enhance your experience when using them.

In relation to Google Analytics you can opt out of the collection of this information using the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

To send out our news we use MailChimp. This provides online tools that can be used to create, send, and manage emails.

MailChimp may collect personal information, such as distribution lists that contain email addresses, and other information relating to those email addresses.

If you want further information about the type of personal information MailChimp collects, you can refer to the [MailChimp Privacy Policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

We use social networking services such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Tumblr and GitHub to communicate with the public about our work.

When you communicate with us using these services we might collect your personal information, but we only use it to help us to communicate with you and the public generally.

The social networking service will also handle your personal information for its own purposes. These sites have their own privacy policies.

We use Eventbrite to facilitate registration and attendance at DTA events, including training on using Guides products. When you register for an event using this service we might collect your personal information, so we can facilitate your registration and attendance at the relevant event. [Eventbrite will handle your personal information and has its own privacy policy](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy?lg=en_AU).

## Holding your personal information

To help protect the privacy of data and personal information we collect and hold, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards.

We regularly assess the risk of misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure of personal information, and take measures to address those risks. For example, we:
  - take appropriate measures to protect electronic materials and materials stored and generated in hard copy
  - update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis
  - restrict access to your personal information to employees who need it to provide benefits or services to you
  - train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information
  - keep a record (audit trail) of when someone within the DTA has added, changed or deleted personal information held in our electronic databases and check that staff only access those records when they need to
  - ensure that people we contract with, where possible, are subject to the same strict privacy obligations that we operate under
  - conduct regular internal and external audits to assess whether we have adequately complied with or implemented these measures.

Personal information that we collect and hold is generally contained in a ‘Commonwealth record’ as defined in the [Commonwealth Archives Act 1983](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796).

We manage Commonwealth records in accordance with the Archives Act, the [Administrative Functions Disposal Authority](http://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/records-authorities/types-of-records-authorities/AFDA/index.aspx), and any relevant Records Disposal Authority.

## Disclosing (sharing) your personal information and sensitive information

[Schedule 1](#schedule-1) describes in more detail when we generally disclose each type of personal information we collect.

We only disclose your sensitive information for the purposes for which you gave it to us or for directly related purposes you would reasonably expect or if you agree.

The DTA discloses personal information to a number of service providers it uses. These include providers that host our website servers, manage our IT and manage our human resources information.

To protect the personal information we disclose, we enter into a contract or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which requires the service provider to only use or disclose the information for the purposes of the contract or MOU. We also include special privacy requirements in the contract or MOU, where necessary.

We are generally not likely to disclose personal information to a person (other than you) who is not in Australia or an external Territory. However:
  - web traffic information is disclosed to Google Analytics when you visit our websites --- Google stores information across multiple countries.
  - when you communicate with us through a social network service such as Facebook or Twitter, the social network provider and its partners may collect and hold your personal information overseas
  - when you comment on, log issues or submit pull requests to GitHub repositories hosting code for Guides products --- GitHub stores information in the United States of America.

If you communicate with us through email, your email service provider may store information in data centres outside of Australia. If you provide us with your email address, you are authorising us to send your personal information to this address.

## Rights and choices

We try to make sure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, up-to-date and complete. To do this, we:
  - record information in a consistent format
  - where necessary, confirm the accuracy of information we collect from a third party or a public source
  - promptly add updated or new personal information to existing records
  - review the quality of personal information before we use or disclose it.

At no cost, you can:
  - request access to personal information about you that we hold
  - ask us to correct your personal information if you find that it is not accurate, up-to-date or complete.

To protect your privacy and the privacy of others, we will need evidence of your identity before we can grant you access to information about you or change it.

We will try to respond to your request within 30 days. If we think it will take us longer to respond to your request, we will provide you with a date by which we expect to respond.

If you ask, we must give you access to your personal information, and take reasonable steps to correct it if we consider it is incorrect, unless there is a law that allows or requires us not to. If we cannot provide you with access to information, we will give you a written notice setting out our reasons.

If we make a correction and we have disclosed the incorrect information to others, you can ask us to tell them about the correction. We must do so unless there is a valid reason not to.

If we refuse to correct your personal information, you can ask us to for example, attach or link a statement to your personal information which states that you believe the information is incorrect and why.

You also have the right under the [Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562) to ask for access to documents that we hold, and to ask for information that we hold about you to be changed or annotated if it is incomplete, incorrect, out-of-date or misleading.

## How to make a complaint

If you think that we have interfered with your privacy or otherwise breached our obligations under the APPs, you can make a complaint to us.

Any complaints should be in writing, setting out as much detail as possible, and addressed to our Privacy Officer.

We will take reasonable steps to investigate any complaint, and to notify you of the outcome of our investigation, within 30 days.

We will assess and handle any complaints about the conduct of a DTA officer using the [APS Values and Code of Conduct in the Public Service ACT 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00420) and the guidelines issued by the [Australian Public Service Commission](http://www.apsc.gov.au/).

If we do not respond to your complaint within 30 days, or you are not satisfied with the outcome of our investigations, you can [make a complaint directly to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/making-a-privacy-complaint).
